# Cred

This tool is in initial developement phase and is build with the purpose to scan the git repo for AWS creds.


## How to run?

Currently in order to run the codebase one has to clone the repo with 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AvineshTripathi/cred.git
```


In order to run it 

```bash
go run .
``` 

The program will ask you for a repo link and that will be the repo the code will scan.
